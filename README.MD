## Connected squares

https://aaes.github.io/connectedSquares/index.html

A small side-project that randomly generates connected squares in a grid.

## Usage

Clone the repository and open the "sprites.html" file.
The project uses Typescript so if you want to extend it, you can

- Install typescript (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling)
- Open the project folder and run "tsc -b" (use "tsc -w" for watch mode)
- Open the index.html file
